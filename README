NAME

    Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag - Output the lines of code that resulted in a
    failure.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin injects diagnostics messages that include the lines of
    source that executed to produce the test failure. This is a less
    magical answer to Damian Conway's Test::Expr module, that has the
    benefit of working on any Test2 based test.

SYNOPSIS

    This test:

        use Test2::V0;
        use Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag;
    
        ok(0, "fail");
    
        done_testing;

    Produces the output:

        not ok 1 - fail
        Failure source code:
        # ------------
        # 4: ok(0, "fail");
        # ------------
        # Failed test 'fail'
        # at test.pl line 4.
