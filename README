NAME

    Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag - Output the lines of code that resulted in a
    failure.

DESCRIPTION

    This plugin injects diagnostics messages that include the lines of
    source that executed to produce the test failure. This is a less
    magical answer to Damian Conway's Test::Expr module, that has the
    benefit of working on any Test2 based test.

SYNOPSIS

    This test:

        use Test2::V0;
        use Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag;
    
        ok(0, "fail");
    
        done_testing;

    Produces the output:

        not ok 1 - fail
        Failure source code:
        # ------------
        # 4: ok(0, "fail");
        # ------------
        # Failed test 'fail'
        # at test.pl line 4.

IMPORT OPTIONS

 show_source

        use Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag show_source => $bool;

    show_source is set to on by default. You can specify 0 if you want to
    turn it off.

    Source output:

        not ok 1 - fail
        Failure source code:
        # ------------
        # 4: ok(0, "fail");
        # ------------
        # Failed test 'fail'
        # at test.pl line 4.

 show_args

        use Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag show_args => $bool

    show_args is set to off by default. You can turn it on with a true
    value.

    Args output:

        not ok 1 - fail
        Failure source code:
        # ------------
        # 4: ok($x, "fail");
        # ------------
        # Failure Arguments: (0, 'fail')      <----- here
        # Failed test 'fail'
        # at test.pl line 4.

 inject_name

        use Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag inject_name => $bool

    inject_name is off by default. You may turn it on if desired.

    This feature will inject the source as the name of your assertion if
    the name has not already been set. When this happens the failure source
    diag will not be seen as the name is sufficient.

        not ok 1 - ok($x eq $y);
        # Failed test 'ok($x eq $y);'
        # at test.pl line 4.

    note: This works perfectly fine with multi-line statements.
